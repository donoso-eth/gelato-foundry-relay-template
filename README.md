# Gelato Foundry template for Relay

The purpose of this repo is to showcase examples of using Gelato Relay with Foundry enviroment. 


## Geting started

Fist we need to install Foundry in order to run `forge` commands. We can found all Foundry relevant information at the [Foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), and wth regards to [installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation). The method I've used is **build from source**

Once we have foundry installed we can move on

### forge init
The command `forge init` would scaffold a new foundry project, we have inlcuded relay examples and added typescript support for some helper funcitons (the vanilla forge repo does not have npm_modules)

So let's go ahead:

`git clone https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation`

`cd sadad`

`yarn`


### forge? vs helpers
When starting with foundry sometimes is difficult to remember the diferent commnads and parameters, therefore we have created a set of scripts to ease the foundry onboarding
